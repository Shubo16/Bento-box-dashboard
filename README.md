# Fitness Bento Dashboard

## What I have created

---

- A dashboard for those are interested or live a lifestyle that caters to a proactive. The dashboard will be used to show the activities they can choose from to do for the day to straight from the home dashboard. The dashboard will also show their weekly activities, within a three to four day advance.
- The dashboard is split into three sections, including the navigation bar.
    - These are the nav-sidebar, the main content of the home dashboard and user based content
- The main navbar, being a sidebar. This will contain the App name and the buttons for each section of the
- The main content contains the activities the user would like to partake in, although there is no action taken with these activities ***1**
- The bottom left container contains a small 4-day ahead calendar, listing the activities that have been marked from the calendar. Date and day is shown as well as the activity and the the amount of participants are shown below from the friends list.  On the right of each date there will be a join button if one has not joined yet. If user does choose to join from or not from the home dashboard, the clicking the join button will notify the user that they have already joined or will lead them to the activities page. *2
- In addition to this, the bottom left of the container also contains the personal best section. The personal best section will contain the users best stats from set activities. This will also have further improvements later on with a dedicated page in the fitness tab, taking inspiration from apples fitness and health app as well as the nike run and other fitness apps *3
- Moving on to the right section, this focuses on the user. The nav-bar for the user displays messages received, notifications, the user pfp icon and the users name will also be displayed. *4
- Below this will be the active calories, set from the health and fitness tab, this will show the active calories counting from today, this week and the month. *4
- Within the mobile and tablet or smaller screen devices, the personal best tracker will sit there. *5
- Below this there will be the friends activity (social hub)
    - Friends and the user can post and the posts will be listed here, each post will look similar to that of a facebook post or instagram post: each post contain the users name, image IF posted and caption then below it. *6

- *6  Adding a post button and a scrollbar section so that the user can scroll and see other posts and also create posts themselves. This will come up with a prompt on screen on the right hand side asking fro an image and caption, which will then be posted on the top of each post. Will also try to incorporate a time stamp with date and time.
